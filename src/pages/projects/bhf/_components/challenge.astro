        Despite its global success, BHF recognized that
        their existing systems were holding them back from
        optimizing operations and enhancing overall
        efficiency. The company faced several key
        challenges: Scalability Issues, Manual Processes,
        Communication Issues, and more.

        To tackle this complex challenge, BHF brought me on
