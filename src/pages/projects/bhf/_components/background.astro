        Throughout this journey, I've led the technical
        direction, mentored new team members, and worked
        closely with stakeholders to ensure the system meets
        and exceeds BHF's evolving needs. The trust placed
        in me by the company owner allowed us to make
        strategic decisions that have had a profound impact
        on BHF's global operations.
      </p>
      <p class="col-span-5 row-start-3">
        This evolution transformed BHF's operational
        landscape, positioning the company at the forefront
        of technological innovation in the home textile
        industry
